      When will you use an arrow function? When will you NOT use an arrow
      function?

      <h4>When to use:</h4>
      <p>
        In classic function expressions, the this keyword is bound to different
        values based on the context in which it is called. With arrow functions
        however, this is lexically bound. It means that it usesthis from the
        code that contains the arrow function
      </p>
      <p>
        Eg: var obj = { id: 42, counter: function counter() {
        setTimeout(function() { console.log(this.id); }.bind(this), 1000); } };
      </p>
      <p>
        In the ES5 example, .bind(this) is required to help pass the this
        context into the function. Otherwise, by default this would be
        undefined.
      </p>
      <p>
        ES6 arrow functions canâ€™t be bound to a this keyword, so it will
        lexically go up a scope, and use the value of this in the scope in which
        it was defined.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h4>When NOT to use</h4>
      <p>Eg: let cat={ lives:9, jumps:()=>{ this.lives--; } }</p>
      <p>
        In this case, lives would not deduct as this is not bound to the cat or
        any object in this case, but will inherit the value of this from the
        parent scope
